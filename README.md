## Why Next.js?

- Next.js removes the burden of configuring routes while leveraging the simplicity and familiarity of single-page applications.

## Fan of SPA?

- By starting with Next.js and its static application capabilities, you can enjoy the benefits of a highly optimized SPA, and when the need arises, effortlessly introduce ssr, ssg, isr and api routes to enhance the interactivity and performance of your application, you can perform client-only fetching with tanstack-query/react-query or similar approaches.
- Next.js provides features like automatic code splitting, client-side routing, and optimized loading of assets.

## Why Typescript?

- Improved Productivity and Fewer Bugs
- Take the `hooks/useDebouncedState` as an example.

## Why choose tanstack-query/react-query?

- While state management libraries can be helpful, they are not always necessary. Tanstack/React Query hooks provide a robust solution for managing server state effectively.
- If you prefer a lightweight and straightforward alternative to Redux, Zustand is a great choice. It offers improved performance and simplicity.
- By utilizing jotai, you can simplify your code and avoid the complexities that come with using traditional Context APIs. This approach provides a more streamlined and efficient way of managing state.

## Why choose shadcdn/ui?

- Shadcdn/ui is an inspired library that draws from radix-UI, emphasizing accessibility and customizable components.
- This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
- Explore the [shadcdn/ui Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for detailed documentation and usage instructions.
- If you need to reconfigure the template setup, you can find guidance in the [configuration guide.](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli)

## Where is prettier?

- The use of Prettier is optional because some developers may choose not to use it.

## Why pnpm?

- pnpm is a package manager that offers several advantages over traditional package managers like npm or yarn.
- To install pnpm, you can run the command `npm install -g pnpm`. This will globally install pnpm on your system.
